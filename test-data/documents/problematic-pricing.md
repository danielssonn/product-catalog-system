## PROBLEMATIC PRICING ISSUES

### Issue 1: Fee Inconsistency
The monthly fee waiver requires $25,000 balance, but this is **significantly higher** than our competitors who require $10,000-$15,000. This may violate our internal competitive pricing policy.

### Issue 2: Overdraft Fee Cap Issue
Maximum daily overdraft fees of $195 (5 x $39) **EXCEEDS** the regulatory guidance suggesting caps around $150 per day. This may expose the bank to regulatory scrutiny.

### Issue 3: Pricing Variance from Standard
Cash handling fees are **47% higher** than our published standard schedule:
- Standard: $3.40 per $1,000 cash deposit
- This product: $5.00 per $1,000 cash deposit
- **Variance: 47% increase**

This exceeds our 15% pricing variance approval threshold and requires executive approval per policy BCP-2024-07.

### Issue 4: Missing Disclosure
**NO TRUTH IN SAVINGS DISCLOSURE PROVIDED**. This is a **regulatory violation** under Regulation DD (12 CFR 1030). Account cannot be offered without compliant disclosure.

### Issue 5: Fee Structure Complexity
Transaction fee structure counts all transaction types together (deposits, checks, ACH, wires) which is **non-standard** and potentially confusing. Industry practice separates these categories. This may violate our consumer protection policy requiring clear, non-deceptive pricing.

### Issue 6: International Wire Fee Discrepancy
Incoming international wire fee ($25) is **LOWER** than outgoing domestic wire fee ($30). This is illogical and suggests a pricing error, as international wires have higher costs.

### Issue 7: Coin Handling Premium
Coin deposit fee ($10 per $100 = 10%) is **significantly higher** than cash deposit fee ($5 per $1,000 = 0.5%). While coin handling is more expensive, a 20x markup may be considered exploitative under UDAAP guidance.
