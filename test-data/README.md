## Document Descriptions in Tests

When testing, document content is provided to Claude via the `description` field. The actual markdown files are for reference and documentation purposes. In production, documents would be:

1. **Attached as files** to the workflow submission
2. **Stored in document management system** and referenced by ID
3. **Embedded as content** in the request payload

For these tests, we simulate document content through detailed descriptions that capture:
- Key sections and content
- Regulatory disclosures present/missing
- Known issues or problems
- Completeness status
