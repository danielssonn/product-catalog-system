## Key Architectural Concepts Added

### 1. Context Resolution Architecture

**Business Problem Solved**:
- Manual tenant ID extraction → Automatic from party organization
- Inconsistent security context → Centralized context resolution
- No audit trail → Complete party + tenant context in logs

**Technical Solution**:
- Party Service resolves: Principal → Party → Tenant → Permissions
- API Gateway injects: X-Processing-Context headers
- Business Services extract: ContextHolder.getRequiredContext()

**Performance**:
- Cold: 878ms (Neo4j graph traversal)
- Cached: <100ms (95% hit rate)

---

### 2. Party-Centric Security Model

**Separation of Concerns**:
- **Auth Service**: WHO (JWT with principal ID)
- **Party Service**: WHAT/WHERE (party, tenant, permissions)
- **Business Services**: Business logic (using context)

**Tenant Resolution**:
- Organization → tenantId = self
- Individual → tenantId = employer (via EMPLOYED_BY)
- LegalEntity → tenantId = parent org (via HAS_LEGAL_ENTITY)
- Fallback → tenantId = party federatedId

---

### 3. Graph-Based Relationships

**Why Neo4j**:
- Natural modeling: EMPLOYED_BY, PARENT_OF, MANAGES_ON_BEHALF_OF
- Efficient traversal: Single-hop queries for tenant resolution
- Flexible schema: Add new relationship types without schema migration

**Context Resolution Query**:
```cypher
// Find party
MATCH (party:Party)-[:SOURCED_FROM]->(src:SourceRecord)
WHERE src.sourceSystem = 'AUTH_SERVICE'
  AND src.sourceId = $principalId
RETURN party

// Resolve tenant
MATCH (ind:Individual {federatedId: $partyId})-[:EMPLOYED_BY]->(org:Organization)
WHERE org.status = 'ACTIVE'
RETURN org.federatedId as tenantId
```
