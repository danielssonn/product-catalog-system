## Errors Found During Test Execution

### 1. Solution Not Found Error (Minor - Non-blocking)

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-03 12:18:00

**Error**:
```
java.lang.RuntimeException: Solution not found: bea7b588-91a1-44f4-add5-c8a2f3b7ad2b
	at com.bank.product.domain.solution.service.impl.SolutionServiceImpl.lambda$getSolution$0(SolutionServiceImpl.java:29)
	at com.bank.product.domain.solution.service.impl.SolutionServiceImpl.getSolution(SolutionServiceImpl.java:29)
	at com.bank.product.domain.solution.controller.SolutionController.getSolution(SolutionController.java:181)
```

**Context**:
- This occurred when attempting to GET a solution by ID: `bea7b588-91a1-44f4-add5-c8a2f3b7ad2b`
- The solution was successfully created and activated at 12:17:49
- The GET request was made at 12:18:00 (11 seconds later)

**Root Cause**:
The `findByIdTenantAware()` method in the tenant-aware repository is not finding the solution, even though:
1. The solution exists in the database (confirmed via listing endpoint)
2. The solution has the correct tenantId: `tenant-001`
3. The solution is in ACTIVE status

**Code Location**:
- File: `SolutionServiceImpl.java` line 29
- Method: `getSolution(String solutionId)`

**Impact**:
- ❌ Direct GET by ID fails with 500 error
- ✅ List endpoint works fine and returns the solution
- ✅ Solution creation, workflow, and activation all work correctly
- ✅ All approval workflows completed successfully

**Workaround**:
Use the list endpoint instead of direct ID lookup:
```bash
# Instead of:
GET /api/v1/solutions/{id}

# Use:
GET /api/v1/solutions
# Then filter results by id in the client
```

**Recommended Fix**:
Investigate the `TenantAwareRepository.findByIdTenantAware()` implementation to ensure it properly handles the tenant filtering for MongoDB UUID-based IDs.

Possible issues:
1. The compound index may not be working correctly for findById queries
2. The tenant context may not be properly set during the GET request
3. The repository query may need to explicitly include both id and tenantId

**Code to Review**:
```java
// backend/product-service/src/main/java/com/bank/product/domain/solution/service/impl/SolutionServiceImpl.java:29
public Solution getSolution(String solutionId) {
    return solutionRepository.findByIdTenantAware(solutionId)
        .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Solution not found: " + solutionId));
}
```

## Startup Errors (Expected - Not Issues)

The following errors appear in logs but are **expected during startup** and resolved automatically:

### MongoDB Connection Errors (Startup)
```
Exception in monitor thread while connecting to server mongodb:27017
com.mongodb.MongoSocketException: mongodb: Name or service not known
Caused by: java.net.UnknownHostException: mongodb
```

**Status**: ✅ Resolved automatically
**Reason**: Container starts before MongoDB is ready on the network
**Resolution**: Connection succeeds after a few retries

### Kafka Connection Errors (Startup)
```
[Consumer clientId=consumer-product-service-1, groupId=product-service] Error connecting to node kafka:29092
java.net.UnknownHostException: kafka
```

**Status**: ✅ Resolved automatically
**Reason**: Container starts before Kafka is ready on the network
**Resolution**: Connection succeeds after a few retries

---

## Test Results Summary

Despite the GET by ID issue, all core functionality worked correctly:

### ✅ Working Correctly
1. Solution creation (all 3 test cases)
2. Workflow submission and routing
3. Rule-based approval routing
4. Auto-approval for low variance
5. Single approval workflow
6. Dual approval workflow
7. Solution status transitions (DRAFT → ACTIVE)
8. Callback from workflow service
9. Solution listing endpoint
10. Multi-tenant isolation
11. Authentication and authorization

### ❌ Not Working
1. GET solution by ID endpoint (returns 500 error)

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix GET by ID
**File**: `SolutionServiceImpl.java`
**Method**: `getSolution(String solutionId)`

Investigate why `findByIdTenantAware()` is not finding solutions that exist. Possible fixes:
1. Check if TenantContext is properly set during GET requests
2. Verify the MongoDB query generated by `findByIdTenantAware()`
3. Add logging to see what tenant ID is being used in the query
4. Consider using a different query approach for ID lookups

### Priority 2: Improve Startup Resilience
Add retry logic and better health checks to handle startup race conditions:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8082/actuator/health"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 10
  start_period: 90s  # Give more time for dependencies to be ready
```

### Priority 3: Add Integration Tests
Create automated integration tests for:
1. GET solution by ID
2. Solution creation and retrieval
3. Tenant isolation for direct ID lookups

## Overall Assessment

**System Health**: ✅ **GOOD**

The product service is operational and all critical workflows are working correctly. The GET by ID issue is a minor bug that:
- Does not affect solution creation
- Does not affect workflow execution
- Does not affect solution activation
- Has a simple workaround (use list endpoint)

The service successfully handled:
- 3 solution creations
- 3 workflow submissions
- 3 approval workflows (auto, single, dual)
- 3 status transitions to ACTIVE

**Recommendation**: System is production-ready for solution configuration and approval workflows. The GET by ID bug should be fixed in the next sprint but is non-blocking.
