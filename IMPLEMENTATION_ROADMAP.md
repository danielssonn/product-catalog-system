### Complexity Breakdown

#### Very High Complexity (2-3 months each)

**1. party-service**
- **Why Complex:**
  - Neo4j graph modeling and Cypher queries
  - Entity resolution with similarity matching
  - Relationship synthesis from multiple sources
  - Context resolution with caching (<100ms target)
  - Federation from multiple source systems
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with simplified graph model
  - Use Neo4j best practices (indexes, constraints)
  - Incremental entity resolution (manual → automatic)
  - Comprehensive testing with real data

**2. workflow-service**
- **Why Complex:**
  - Temporal workflow orchestration
  - DMN rule engine implementation
  - MCP agent integration (Claude AI)
  - Red flag detection and auto-rejection
  - Callback handlers for multiple entities
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with simple rule-based workflows
  - Add AI agents incrementally (Phase 4)
  - Reuse Temporal best practices
  - Prototype agent integration first

#### High Complexity (1-2 months each)

**3. fine-grained-entitlements (ABAC)**
- **Why Complex:**
  - Resource-scoped permission model (not just role-based)
  - Multiple entitlement sources (explicit, relationship, role, delegation, owner)
  - Constraint evaluation (amount, channel, time, geo, MFA)
  - Performance-critical (must be cached in ProcessingContext)
  - MongoDB indexing strategy for fast lookups
  - Integration with Neo4j relationships (RELATIONSHIP_BASED source)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with simple RBAC, add ABAC incrementally
  - Test constraint evaluation thoroughly
  - Load test entitlement resolution (<50ms target)
  - Comprehensive security testing (prevent privilege escalation)

**4. api-gateway**
- **Why Complex:**
  - Multi-channel routing (6 channel types)
  - Context resolution orchestration
  - Rate limiting with Redis
  - Circuit breakers
  - Request/response transformation
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with single channel (PUBLIC_API)
  - Add channels incrementally
  - Leverage Spring Cloud Gateway features

**4. product-service**
- **Why Complex:**
  - Two-tier product model (Catalog + Solution)
  - Outbox pattern for guaranteed events
  - Tenant isolation at all layers
  - Workflow integration
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with basic CRUD
  - Add outbox pattern (Phase 2)
  - Incremental workflow integration

**5. cross-sell-service**
- **Why Complex:**
  - Recommendation algorithm
  - Integration with product + party data
  - Real-time scoring
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with rule-based recommendations
  - Add ML models later (Phase 6)

## Phased Delivery Roadmap

### Roadmap Principles

1. **MVP Every Phase:** Each phase delivers a working, production-deployable platform
2. **Business Value First:** No phase without demonstrable business capability
3. **Incremental Complexity:** Start simple (single-tenant) → Add complexity (multi-tenant, AI, federation)
4. **De-Risk Early:** Critical dependencies (party, context) in Phase 2 (not deferred)
5. **Continuous Delivery:** Each phase can go to production if business decides to stop

---

### Phase 1: Single-Tenant with Party Foundation (Months 1-4)

**MVP:** Working product catalog with **party-aware context resolution** for ONE tenant

**Objective:** First production release with extensible party foundation

**Why Party in Phase 1:** Party awareness and context resolution are **foundational architecture**, not optional features. Required for:
- Relationship management ("manages on behalf of")
- Fine-grained entitlements (resource-scoped permissions)
- Proper audit trails (party + tenant context)
- Delegation scenarios
- **Better to build foundation right the first time than refactor everything later**

#### Components to Deliver

**Infrastructure (Month 1):**
- ✅ MongoDB (3-node replica set recommended)
- ✅ **Neo4j** (single node or Aura for dev, 3-node Causal Cluster for prod)
- ✅ Kafka (3-broker cluster recommended)
- ✅ Temporal server + UI
- ✅ **Redis** (3-node cluster for caching)
- ✅ **Claude API** (Anthropic API key, Spring AI 1.0.0 library setup)
- ✅ Docker Compose for local dev
- ✅ Kubernetes manifests for cloud

**Party Foundation (Month 2):**
- ✅ **party-service** (core implementation, single-tenant scoped)
  - Neo4j party graph model (Organization, LegalEntity, Individual)
  - Party CRUD API
  - Basic relationship modeling (PARENT_OF, EMPLOYED_BY, AUTHORIZED_SIGNER)
  - Indexes and constraints
  - Initial data loading (100-1,000 parties for tenant-001)
  - **Context resolution endpoint:** /api/v1/context/resolve
  - Principal → Party → Tenant resolution (hardcoded tenant-001)
  - Permission enrichment (RBAC)

- [ ] **Time-to-market value:** $1.451M/year ($326K cost savings + $1.125M capacity revenue)
- [ ] **Total Phase 1 value:** $2.428M/year

#### Business Value (PRODUCTION DEPLOYABLE)

**Value Delivered:**
- ✅ **First production release:** Working product launch capability
- ✅ **Party foundation established:** Extensible architecture from day 1
- ✅ **Context resolution:** WHO → WHAT/WHERE (automatic)
- ✅ **Relationship management:** Supports delegation scenarios
- ✅ **Proper audit trail:** Party + tenant context in all logs
- ✅ **Fine-grained entitlement ready:** Foundation for ABAC (Phase 2+)

**Metrics:**
- **Product launch time:** 35 days per product (30% reduction from 50-day baseline)
- **Annual capacity:** 25 products/year (+5 vs baseline 20)
- **FTE reduction:** 5.2 FTEs eliminated

### Phase 2: Multi-Tenant + Fine-Grained Entitlements (Months 5-7)

**MVP:** Multi-tenant platform with **resource-scoped permissions** (ABAC)

**Objective:** Secure multi-tenant platform with fine-grained entitlements

**Why This MVP:** Multi-tenancy + fine-grained entitlements enable enterprise-grade security. Party foundation from Phase 1 makes this straightforward.

#### Components to Deliver

**Multi-Tenant Refactoring (Month 5):**
- ✅ **party-service** (multi-tenant)
  - Remove hardcoded tenant-001
  - Multi-tenant party graph (tenant isolation via labels/properties)
  - Context resolution now resolves tenant from party relationships
  - Support 3+ tenants (tenant-001, tenant-002, tenant-003)
  - Load 1,000+ parties per tenant
- ✅ **product-service** (multi-tenant)
  - Remove hardcoded tenant-001
  - Add TenantAwareRepository pattern
  - Automatic tenant filtering (tenantId from context)
  - MongoDB indexes on tenantId
  - Test with 3 tenants
- ✅ **workflow-service** (multi-tenant)
  - Tenant-scoped workflow instances
  - Tenant isolation in approval tasks
  - Audit logs with tenantId + partyId
- ✅ **audit-service** (multi-tenant)
  - Tenant-scoped audit logs
  - Cross-tenant audit queries (admin only)

**Fine-Grained Entitlements (ABAC) - CRITICAL COMPONENT (Month 6):**

**⭐ WHY CRITICAL:** Fine-grained entitlements enable enterprise-grade security by moving from coarse-grained RBAC (role-based) to ABAC (attribute-based) with resource-scoped permissions. This is essential for:
- **Regulatory compliance:** SOC 2, GDPR, FinCEN KYC/AML requirements
- **Separation of duties:** Prevent unauthorized cross-account/cross-solution access
- **Delegation scenarios:** "Manages on behalf of" with temporary authority
- **Multi-tenant security:** Zero cross-tenant data leaks with automatic enforcement
- **Audit requirements:** Complete trail of who accessed what resource with what constraints

**Implementation (Month 6):**

- ✅ **Entitlement Domain Model** (common module)
  - `Entitlement` entity (MongoDB collection: entitlements)
  - `ResourceType` enum (SOLUTION, ACCOUNT, TRANSACTION, DOCUMENT, BUNDLE, etc.)
  - `ResourceOperation` enum (VIEW, CONFIGURE, TRANSACT, APPROVE, DELETE, etc.)
  - `EntitlementConstraints` (amount limits, channel restrictions, time windows, geo-fencing, MFA requirements)
  - `EntitlementSource` (EXPLICIT_GRANT, RELATIONSHIP_BASED, ROLE_BASED, DELEGATED, OWNER)
  - `ResourcePermissions` model (cached in ProcessingContext)

- ✅ **EntitlementResolutionService** in party-service
  - Load entitlements from MongoDB (indexed by tenantId + partyId + resourceType)
  - Merge entitlements from multiple sources (explicit, relationship, role, delegation)
  - Enrich `PermissionContext` with resource-scoped permissions
  - **Cache in ProcessingContext** (zero DB queries during request authorization)
  - Performance target: <50ms resolution (cached in context)

- ✅ **Permission Check Methods** in business services
  ```java
  // Resource-specific permission
  context.getPermissions().hasPermissionOnResource(VIEW, SOLUTION, "solution-123")

  // Type-level permission (all resources of type)
  context.getPermissions().hasPermissionOnType(CONFIGURE, SOLUTION)

  // Permission with amount constraint
  context.getPermissions().hasPermissionOnResourceWithAmount(
      TRANSACT, ACCOUNT, "account-456", new BigDecimal("50000"))

  // Permission with channel constraint
  context.getPermissions().hasPermissionOnResourceWithChannel(
      CONFIGURE, SOLUTION, "solution-123", "MOBILE")

  // Permission with time window constraint
  context.getPermissions().hasPermissionOnResourceWithTime(
      APPROVE, TRANSACTION, "txn-789", LocalDateTime.now())
  ```

- ✅ **Entitlement Admin API** in party-service
  - `POST /api/v1/entitlements/grant` - Grant entitlement (admin only)
  - `POST /api/v1/entitlements/revoke` - Revoke entitlement (admin only)
  - `GET /api/v1/entitlements` - List entitlements (audit)
  - `GET /api/v1/entitlements/party/{partyId}` - Get party's entitlements
  - `GET /api/v1/entitlements/resource/{resourceType}/{resourceId}` - Get resource entitlements

- ✅ **MongoDB Indexes (Performance-Critical)**
  ```javascript
  db.entitlements.createIndex(
      { "tenantId": 1, "partyId": 1, "resourceType": 1 },
      { name: "tenant_party_resource_idx" }
  )
  db.entitlements.createIndex(
      { "tenantId": 1, "resourceType": 1, "resourceId": 1 },
      { name: "tenant_resource_idx" }
  )
  db.entitlements.createIndex(
      { "tenantId": 1, "partyId": 1, "active": 1 },
      { name: "tenant_party_active_idx" }
  )
  ```

- ✅ **Entitlement Sources Explained:**
  - **EXPLICIT_GRANT:** Admin manually grants permission (e.g., Alice can VIEW solution-123)
  - **RELATIONSHIP_BASED:** Derived from Neo4j relationships (e.g., AuthorizedSigner on account → TRANSACT permission)
  - **ROLE_BASED:** From user roles (e.g., ROLE_ADMIN → full access to all resources)
  - **DELEGATED:** Temporary delegation with expiration (e.g., Alice delegates to Bob for 7 days)
  - **OWNER:** Creator of resource gets full access (e.g., Alice created solution-123 → owns it)

**Documentation:** See [FINE_GRAINED_ENTITLEMENTS.md](FINE_GRAINED_ENTITLEMENTS.md) for complete architecture and implementation guide.

**Multi-Tenant Testing & Validation (Month 7):**
- ✅ **Tenant Isolation Test Suite**
  - test-tenant-isolation.sh (comprehensive cross-tenant leak tests)
  - Validate: Tenant A cannot see Tenant B data
  - Validate: Context resolution resolves correct tenant
